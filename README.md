# SBUS_READ
Read the RC values via SBUS from receiver.
I used STM32F103CBT6 microcontroller to read the RC values of 16 channels in SBUS1.
I used Herelink transmitter and receiver for RC read.
I enabled UART1 and global interrupt of UART1.
Herewith I have used Transistor circuit.
I used BC547 transistor.
Required resistors - 4.7k and 10k.
